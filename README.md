## Things are only impossible until they are not - *Captain Jean-Luc Picard*

I am chemical engineer from Italy, who loves coding and Star Trek! I believe that **open source is the perfect way to create something amazing**.  
I mainly code in **C++** and **Python**, but I like to try and learn different programming languages. I am currently
working on different open-source projects, mainly related to **model chemical reactors**.

## ðŸ¤” Always looking for help

I think the point of an **open source project** is to have **contributors**. So, I always look for someone that wants to contribute and help me developing something **amazing**.
